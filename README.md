#Tello Drone and OpenCV Project
Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of a Tello drone with OpenCV for computer vision tasks. The primary focus is on detecting shapes, performing camera calibration, and using ArUco markers for navigation.

Features
Hybrid Image Creation: Combining different frequency components from two images.
Edge Detection: Utilizing Sobel and Canny edge detection techniques.
Contour Detection: Identifying and analyzing shapes within images.
Image Filtering: Adjusting saturation, contrast, and brightness.
Hough Transform: Line detection and shape recognition.
Camera Calibration: Using distortion coefficients and calibration matrices.
Pose Estimation: Determining object orientation and position.
ArUco Marker Detection: Facilitating augmented reality applications and object tracking.
Drone Navigation: Programming a Tello Drone to track ArUco markers using Python.
Image Undistortion: Correcting lens distortion for improved image accuracy.
